# Hi~ I'm Michelle Hwang. ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning Flutter at Semin Vocational College.   
Flutter is fun, so I'm learning hard.   
I have experience working as a web programmer from 2000 to 2008.   
After getting married, I studied as a social worker, got a real estate agent license, and worked in related jobs.   
Now I have an app that I want to make related to real estate, so I started studying Flutter.   
After studying Flutter, I'm going to start a business by creating a real estate app.   
The record for my dreams will be on gitHub.   
Often come to my gitHub and watch it~
