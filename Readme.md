# Hi~ I'm Michelle Hwang. ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning ***Flutter*** at Semin Vocational College.   
   
***Flutter*** is fun, so I'm learning hard.   
   
I have experience working as a web programmer from 2000 to 2008.   
   
After getting married, I studied as a social worker, got a real estate agent license, and worked in related jobs.   
   
Now I have an app that I want to make related to real estate, so I started studying Flutter.   
   
***After studying Flutter***, I will study ***Spring Boot***, ***Kubernetes***.
   
And I plan to start a business and all of this will be recorded on gitHub.

Often come to my gitHub and watch it~
